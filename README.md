Churn Prediction System – Machine Learning (Task 2)

Project Overview:-
- This project was completed as part of the Future Interns – Machine Learning Internship (Task 2)
- The objective of this project is to build a Churn Prediction System that identifies customers who are likely to leave a service using machine learning techniques.

Predicting churn helps businesses take **proactive retention actions**, improve customer satisfaction, and reduce revenue loss.

Dataset Information:-
- Dataset Name:Telco Customer Churn Dataset
- Source:Kaggle
- Domain:Telecom
- Target Variable:Churn
  - Customer Churned
  - Customer Retained

 Key Features Used:
- Tenure
- Monthly Charges
- Total Charges
- Contract Type
- Payment Method
- Internet Service
- Churn Probability (Predicted)

 Machine Learning Models Used
- The following classification models were trained and evaluated:

- Logistic Regression**
- Random Forest Classifier**

After evaluation, Random Forest performed better and was used for churn probability prediction.

Model Performance:-
- Evaluation Metrics Used:-
  - Accuracy
  - Precision
  - Recall
  - F1-Score
  - Confusion Matrix
